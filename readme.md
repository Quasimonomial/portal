#Travis Herrick's Github

Hello all, and welcome.  If you see this page, you are probably a potential person who is considering hiring me, or maybe I just want to show you all the cool stuff I built.  Here is a list of cool projects I built, and a bit of a tour through some of the work I'm more proud of.  This is a tour of my stuff, so follow the links.  Hopefully this should streamline the process of looking at my code- I try to be nothing if not organized.


##Good Things
[Source Code](https://github.com/Quasimonomial/Final-Project)

This is a clone of Goodreads.  I pull data from the google books api.


##Chess
[Source Code](https://github.com/Quasimonomial/ruby_chess)

It's chess!  Everybody loves chess.  This is a game that I set up in ruby, it's rad.  Check it out.

##Mastermind AI
[Source Code](https://github.com/Quasimonomial/App_Academy_Week1/blob/master/w1d3/mastermind.rb)

[Mastermind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastermind_%28board_game%29) is a board game, it's kinda cool.  Anyway, this is a ruby implimentation of the game - the human player can either try to guess a code the computer comes up with, or the player can come up with a code for the computer to guess.

Of course, it's impossible for the player to win if they try to generate a code to fool the computer.  The computer is smart enough to figure out any code within about eight guesses.

##Minesweeper
[Source Code](https://github.com/Quasimonomial/js_minesweeper)
This is very much a work in progress, it's a javascript based Minesweeper Game Meant to be played in the Browser.
