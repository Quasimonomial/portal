#Travis Herrick's Github

Hello all.  This is a splash page to show off all the cool stuff I built.  Below are a bunch of projects and a bit of a tour of my stuff, so feel free to follow the links and click on things.  Looking through a person's github is sometimes a headache - hopefully this should streamline the process. I try to be nothing if not organized.

##PricePda

[Live Site](http://pricepda.herokuapp.com/)

This is a comparison tool for tracing prices for retailers.

The concept is that retailers sign up for the site, and enter their prices for various products.  The admins track several companies - lets say Target and Walmart.  Users can use the tool to compare their prices with that of their main competitors.

Use the guest and guest admin buttons to sign in, it makes things easier.

I also used the gem RubyXL to run everything based on excel files - you can upload your prices as a user and an admin can upload into the product database.  If you are just checking out the site, there is no need to fill out a spreadsheet manually.  If you want to check out this functionality, I've added links to get you spreadsheets that are pre filled out.

The table is responsive and sortable, you can filter products based on various categories, and you can search for the products you want to look for.

##Mastermind AI
[Source Code](https://github.com/Quasimonomial/App_Academy_Week1/blob/master/w1d3/mastermind.rb)

[Mastermind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastermind_%28board_game%29) is a board game, it's kinda cool.  Anyway, this is a ruby implimentation of the game - the human player can either try to guess a code the computer comes up with, or the player can come up with a code for the computer to guess.

Of course, it's impossible for the player to win if they try to generate a code to fool the computer.  The computer is smart enough to figure out any code within about eight guesses or so. 

The Game is played in the console.


##Chess
