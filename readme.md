#Travis Herrick's Github

Hello all, and welcome.  If you see this page, you are probably a potential person who is considering hiring me, or maybe I just want to show you all the cool stuff I built.  Here is a list of cool projects I built, and a bit of a tour through some of the work I'm more proud of.  This is a tour of my stuff, so follow the links.  Hopefully this should streamline the process of looking at my code- I try to be nothing if not organized.
