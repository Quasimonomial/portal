Hello all, and welcolme.  If you see this page, you are probably an employer of some sort considering to hire me, or I've given you a link to show off all my cool stuff.  This is just a list of what Projects I have and why I'm proud of them and what I feel might interest you.  There are a bunch of links here, and this is primarily an attempt to streamline the process so you can look through my code in as streamlined a way as possible.  I try to be nothing if not organized.

If you see this sentance, it means this is my initial commit to the portal and it's under construction over the next day or so.
